📘 Loan Prediction Analysis using Machine Learning
📌 Project Objective
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a loan should be approved or not based on various customer details such as gender, income, employment status, credit history, etc. The goal is to assist financial institutions in making better and faster loan approval decisions.

📊 Techniques Used
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Preprocessing (Handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
Feature Engineering
Model Building (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)

🧠 Libraries Used
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn



📁 Dataset Information
The dataset contains various features related to customer profiles, such as:
Gender, Marital Status, Education
Applicant Income & Coapplicant Income
Loan Amount, Loan Term
Credit History
Property Area
Loan Status (Target Variable)

✅ Project Outcome
A machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a customer's loan application is likely to be approved or not.
